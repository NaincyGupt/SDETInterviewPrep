 pangram is a sentence where every letter of the English alphabet appears at least once.

Given a string sentence containing English letters (lower or upper-case), return true if sentence is a pangram, or false otherwise.

Note: The given sentence might contain other characters like digits or spaces, your solution should handle these too.

Example 1:

Input: sentence = "TheQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog"
Output: true
Explanation: The sentence contains at least one occurrence of every letter of the English alphabet either in lower or upper case.
Example 2:

Input: sentence = "This is not a pangram"
Output: false
Explanation: The sentence doesn't contain at least one occurrence of every letter of the English alphabet.


class Solution {
  public boolean checkIfPangram(String sentence) {
    // TODO: Write your code here
    Set<Character> seen = new HashSet<>();
   for(int i=0;i<sentence.length();i++)
   {
      char currentchar = Character.toLowerCase(sentence.charAt(i));
      if(Character.isLetter(currentchar))
        seen.add(currentchar);
   }
    return seen.size()==26;
  }
}
