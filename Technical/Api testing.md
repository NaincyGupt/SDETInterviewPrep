âœ… Core API Testing Concepts
	â€¢	REST vs SOAP (differences, advantages, use cases)

### Differences

**REST (Representational State Transfer):**
- **Architecture Style:** REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Data Format:** Typically uses JSON, but can also use XML, HTML, or plain text.
- **Stateless:** Each request from a client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
- **URL Structure:** Uses URLs to access resources, making it easy to understand and use.

**SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):**
- **Protocol:** SOAP is a protocol that relies on XML-based messaging.
- **Data Format:** Exclusively uses XML for message format.
- **Stateful:** Can be either stateless or stateful, depending on the need.
- **Complexity:** Generally more complex due to its strict standards and protocols.

### Advantages

**REST:**
- **Simplicity:** Easier to understand and implement due to its use of standard HTTP methods.
- **Performance:** Typically faster and more efficient, especially for web services.
- **Flexibility:** Can handle multiple data formats and is language-agnostic.
- **Scalability:** Better suited for large-scale applications due to its stateless nature.

**SOAP:**
- **Security:** Built-in security features like WS-Security, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.
- **Reliability:** Supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which are crucial for certain applications.
- **Extensibility:** Highly extensible through various standards and protocols.
- **Error Handling:** Provides better error handling through standardized fault codes.

### Use Cases

**REST:**
- **Web Services:** Ideal for web services that require quick and efficient communication.
- **Mobile Applications:** Commonly used in mobile apps due to its lightweight nature.
- **Public APIs:** Preferred for public APIs where simplicity and performance are key.

**SOAP:**
- **Enterprise Applications:** Suitable for applications that require high security and reliability.
- **Payment Gateways:** Often used in payment gateways due to its support for ACID transactions.
- **Legacy Systems:** Works well with legacy systems that already use SOAP.



	â€¢	HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)

### **GET**
- **Purpose:** Retrieve data from the server.
- **Usage:** Used to request data from a specified resource.
- **Example:** Fetching user details from `/users/123`.
- **Characteristics:** Safe and idempotent (multiple identical requests yield the same result).

### **POST**
- **Purpose:** Send data to the server to create a new resource.
- **Usage:** Used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
- **Example:** Creating a new user with `/users`.
- **Characteristics:** Not idempotent (multiple identical requests create multiple resources).

### **PUT**
- **Purpose:** Update an existing resource with new data.
- **Usage:** Used to update a resource at a specified URL.
- **Example:** Updating user details at `/users/123`.
- **Characteristics:** Idempotent (multiple identical requests yield the same result).

### **PATCH**
- **Purpose:** Apply partial modifications to a resource.
- **Usage:** Used to update part of a resource.
- **Example:** Updating the email of a user at `/users/123`.
- **Characteristics:** Not necessarily idempotent (depends on implementation).

### **DELETE**
- **Purpose:** Remove a resource from the server.
- **Usage:** Used to delete a specified resource.
- **Example:** Deleting a user at `/users/123`.
- **Characteristics:** Idempotent (multiple identical requests yield the same result).

These methods are fundamental to RESTful APIs and help in performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 


	â€¢	HTTP status codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx and their meanings)
	â€¢	Request/response structure
	â€¢	headers
	â€¢	query parameters
	â€¢	path parameters

âœ… Automation Framework Questions

As a senior SDET, you will often be asked to design or extend test frameworks. Be ready to discuss:
	â€¢	framework design principles
	â€¢	separating test data from test logic
	â€¢	reporting strategy
	â€¢	integrating with CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.)
	â€¢	test parallelization and scaling
	â€¢	best practices for API test automation
	â€¢	mocking and stubbing using tools like WireMock or MockServer

âœ… Test Strategy & Test Scenarios

Interviewers will often ask you:
	â€¢	How would you design API test cases?
	â€¢	How do you test a GET endpoint vs a POST endpoint?
	â€¢	What are negative test cases for an API?
	â€¢	What is contract testing?
	â€¢	How would you handle testing third-party APIs or rate-limited endpoints?
	â€¢	How to manage test data for APIs (create, clean up, rollback)?

âœ… Performance & Security Testing of APIs
	â€¢	Load testing strategies for APIs
	â€¢	Tools like JMeter, Gatling, k6
	â€¢	Security tests:
	â€¢	SQL injection
	â€¢	XSS
	â€¢	token validation
	â€¢	replay attacks
	â€¢	API rate limiting / throttling
	â€¢	testing for broken object level authorization

âœ… Design & Architecture Questions

As a senior-level candidate, you may also be asked:
	â€¢	How would you design a scalable API testing framework?
	â€¢	How to design tests for microservices with many APIs?
	â€¢	How to test event-driven APIs (e.g., Kafka, webhooks)?
	â€¢	What are contract testing tools (Pact, Spring Cloud Contract)?

âœ… Behavioral / Situational
	â€¢	Describe a time you improved API test coverage.
	â€¢	Tell me about a time you had to advocate for better API test practices.
	â€¢	How do you handle flaky API tests?
	â€¢	How do you prioritize which APIs to test first?

âœ… Coding (for Senior SDET)

Expect a short coding round where you may:
	â€¢	parse JSON responses
	â€¢	write a small REST client
	â€¢	build a test automation class to hit an API endpoint and validate a response
	â€¢	maybe even design a simple mocking service

Languages: Usually Java, Python, or JavaScript depending on the company.
