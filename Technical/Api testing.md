âœ… Core API Testing Concepts
	â€¢	REST vs SOAP (differences, advantages, use cases)

### Differences

**REST (Representational State Transfer):**
- **Architecture Style:** REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Data Format:** Typically uses JSON, but can also use XML, HTML, or plain text.
- **Stateless:** Each request from a client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
- **URL Structure:** Uses URLs to access resources, making it easy to understand and use.

**SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):**
- **Protocol:** SOAP is a protocol that relies on XML-based messaging.
- **Data Format:** Exclusively uses XML for message format.
- **Stateful:** Can be either stateless or stateful, depending on the need.
- **Complexity:** Generally more complex due to its strict standards and protocols.

### Advantages

**REST:**
- **Simplicity:** Easier to understand and implement due to its use of standard HTTP methods.
- **Performance:** Typically faster and more efficient, especially for web services.
- **Flexibility:** Can handle multiple data formats and is language-agnostic.
- **Scalability:** Better suited for large-scale applications due to its stateless nature.

**SOAP:**
- **Security:** Built-in security features like WS-Security, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.
- **Reliability:** Supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which are crucial for certain applications.
- **Extensibility:** Highly extensible through various standards and protocols.
- **Error Handling:** Provides better error handling through standardized fault codes.

### Use Cases

**REST:**
- **Web Services:** Ideal for web services that require quick and efficient communication.
- **Mobile Applications:** Commonly used in mobile apps due to its lightweight nature.
- **Public APIs:** Preferred for public APIs where simplicity and performance are key.

**SOAP:**
- **Enterprise Applications:** Suitable for applications that require high security and reliability.
- **Payment Gateways:** Often used in payment gateways due to its support for ACID transactions.
- **Legacy Systems:** Works well with legacy systems that already use SOAP.



	â€¢	HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)

### **GET**
- **Purpose:** Retrieve data from the server.
- **Usage:** Used to request data from a specified resource.
- **Example:** Fetching user details from `/users/123`.
- **Characteristics:** Safe and idempotent (multiple identical requests yield the same result).

### **POST**
- **Purpose:** Send data to the server to create a new resource.
- **Usage:** Used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
- **Example:** Creating a new user with `/users`.
- **Characteristics:** Not idempotent (multiple identical requests create multiple resources).

### **PUT**
- **Purpose:** Update an existing resource with new data.
- **Usage:** Used to update a resource at a specified URL.
- **Example:** Updating user details at `/users/123`.
- **Characteristics:** Idempotent (multiple identical requests yield the same result).

### **PATCH**
- **Purpose:** Apply partial modifications to a resource.
- **Usage:** Used to update part of a resource.
- **Example:** Updating the email of a user at `/users/123`.
- **Characteristics:** Not necessarily idempotent (depends on implementation).

### **DELETE**
- **Purpose:** Remove a resource from the server.
- **Usage:** Used to delete a specified resource.
- **Example:** Deleting a user at `/users/123`.
- **Characteristics:** Idempotent (multiple identical requests yield the same result).

These methods are fundamental to RESTful APIs and help in performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 


	â€¢	HTTP status codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx and their meanings)

### **2xx: Success**
These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource was created.
- **202 Accepted**: The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing is not complete.
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to send in the response.

### **4xx: Client Error**
These codes indicate that there was an error with the request, typically due to client-side issues.

- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required and has failed or has not been provided.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: The request method is not supported for the requested resource.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.

### **5xx: Server Error**
These codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.

- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is not ready to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server did not receive a timely response from an upstream server.

	â€¢	Request/response structure
	â€¢	headers
	â€¢	query parameters
	â€¢	path parameters
	â€¢	request body
	â€¢	JSON vs XML payloads
	â€¢	Idempotency of HTTP methods
	â€¢	Statelessness of REST APIs
	â€¢	Authentication mechanisms
API Keys: Simple key in headers (e.g., X-API-Key: abc123).
OAuth: Token-based delegation (e.g., OAuth 2.0 for user authorization).
JWT: JSON Web Tokens for secure, stateless access.
Basic Auth: Base64-encoded username:password in headers
	
	â€¢	API versioning strategies
	â€¢	Pagination, filtering, sorting in APIs

What are the Different Types of API Testing?
Here are the different types of API testing :

Functional Testing: Checks if the API functions correctly according to the requirements.
Load Testing: Tests how the API performs under heavy load or many simultaneous requests to check its stability and responsiveness.
Security Testing: Ensures the API is protected against threats like unauthorized access, injection attacks, and data leaks.
Reliability Testing: Verifies that the API can handle requests consistently over time without failures.
Validation Testing: Confirms that the API returns the expected results and follows the correct data format and protocols.
Error Handling Testing: Checks how the API responds to invalid inputs or unexpected conditions, making sure it handles errors gracefully.
Interoperability Testing: Ensures the API works well across different devices, platforms, or systems that interact with it.
Documentation Testing: Reviews the API documentation to ensure it is accurate, complete, and easy to understand for developers.
