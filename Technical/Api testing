Thatâ€™s a great question â€” for a Senior SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) role with a focus on API testing, you can expect the interview to probe deeply on both practical testing skills and architectural/design knowledge.

Hereâ€™s a structured breakdown of topics you should be prepared for:

â¸»

âœ… Core API Testing Concepts
	â€¢	REST vs SOAP (differences, advantages, use cases)
	â€¢	HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
	â€¢	HTTP status codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx and their meanings)
	â€¢	Request/response structure
	â€¢	headers
	â€¢	query parameters
	â€¢	path parameters
	â€¢	request body
	â€¢	JSON vs XML payloads
	â€¢	Idempotency of HTTP methods
	â€¢	Statelessness of REST APIs
	â€¢	Authentication mechanisms
	â€¢	Basic Auth
	â€¢	OAuth 2.0
	â€¢	JWT tokens
	â€¢	API keys
	â€¢	API versioning strategies
	â€¢	Pagination, filtering, sorting in APIs

â¸»

âœ… API Testing Tools
	â€¢	Postman (including scripting with Postman)
	â€¢	REST Assured (Java)
	â€¢	Karate
	â€¢	SOAPUI
	â€¢	Newman (for Postman CLI)
	â€¢	JMeter for performance testing APIs
	â€¢	Familiarity with using cURL from the command line

You should be able to:
	â€¢	write test scripts
	â€¢	chain API calls (multi-step workflow testing)
	â€¢	validate responses with assertions
	â€¢	handle dynamic data and environment variables

â¸»

âœ… Automation Framework Questions

As a senior SDET, you will often be asked to design or extend test frameworks. Be ready to discuss:
	â€¢	framework design principles
	â€¢	separating test data from test logic
	â€¢	reporting strategy
	â€¢	integrating with CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.)
	â€¢	test parallelization and scaling
	â€¢	best practices for API test automation
	â€¢	mocking and stubbing using tools like WireMock or MockServer

â¸»

âœ… Test Strategy & Test Scenarios

Interviewers will often ask you:
	â€¢	How would you design API test cases?
	â€¢	How do you test a GET endpoint vs a POST endpoint?
	â€¢	What are negative test cases for an API?
	â€¢	What is contract testing?
	â€¢	How would you handle testing third-party APIs or rate-limited endpoints?
	â€¢	How to manage test data for APIs (create, clean up, rollback)?

â¸»

âœ… Performance & Security Testing of APIs
	â€¢	Load testing strategies for APIs
	â€¢	Tools like JMeter, Gatling, k6
	â€¢	Security tests:
	â€¢	SQL injection
	â€¢	XSS
	â€¢	token validation
	â€¢	replay attacks
	â€¢	API rate limiting / throttling
	â€¢	testing for broken object level authorization

â¸»

âœ… Design & Architecture Questions

As a senior-level candidate, you may also be asked:
	â€¢	How would you design a scalable API testing framework?
	â€¢	How to design tests for microservices with many APIs?
	â€¢	How to test event-driven APIs (e.g., Kafka, webhooks)?
	â€¢	What are contract testing tools (Pact, Spring Cloud Contract)?

â¸»

âœ… Behavioral / Situational
	â€¢	Describe a time you improved API test coverage.
	â€¢	Tell me about a time you had to advocate for better API test practices.
	â€¢	How do you handle flaky API tests?
	â€¢	How do you prioritize which APIs to test first?

â¸»

âœ… Coding (for Senior SDET)

Expect a short coding round where you may:
	â€¢	parse JSON responses
	â€¢	write a small REST client
	â€¢	build a test automation class to hit an API endpoint and validate a response
	â€¢	maybe even design a simple mocking service

Languages: Usually Java, Python, or JavaScript depending on the company.
